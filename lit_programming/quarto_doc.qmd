## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r mtcars}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)

mtcars |> 
  filter(cyl == 6)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

ggplot(mtcars) + 
  geom_point(aes(cyl, mpg)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(cyl, mpg))

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r echo_example}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
