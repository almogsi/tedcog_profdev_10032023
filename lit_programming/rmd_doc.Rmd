## R Markdown 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r mtcars, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

mtcars |> 
  filter(cyl == 6)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars) + 
  geom_point(aes(cyl, mpg)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(cyl, mpg))

```
